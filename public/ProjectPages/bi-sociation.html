            <h3>Context and Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Arthur Koestler, in his 1964 book, <i><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Act_of_Creation">The Act of Creation</a></i>, 
                discusses the term “bi-sociation”, which is a process of finding connections between two seemingly unrelated contexts. 
                Koestler claims that this discovery is the basis of creative acts. 
                Drawing inspiration from bi-sociation, poly-association is a term that Prof. Bill Seaman coined. 
                It refers to the process of associating two more contexts to find connections among them.

            <h3>Poly-association Interface</h3>

            </div>
            <p>
                As a member of Prof. Bill Seaman’s Insight Engine team, 
                I collaboratively designed an interface with a Duke undergraduate student to visualize the poly-association process. You can see a demo video of the model above.
                The model has an underlying graph structure represented below, 
                where a node represents a concept related to philosophy or French politics and art. 
                A directed edge between two nodes explains how those two concepts are related.

            <div class = "image-container">
                <img src="../images/graph.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the poly-association interface, users can choose two or more concepts to visualize their relationships. 
                The backend algorithm of the interface finds the shortest path between every possible pair of chosen concepts 
                and visualizes values of all nodes and edges in the path on the right-hand side of the interface. 
                The exciting thing is that this process enables conceptual bridges across disciplinary domains 
                that might normally be missed!

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                I presented this interface at the Theoretical and Foundational Problems in Information Studies conference and 
                introduced its participants to a novel way of visualizing poly-associations in a digital platform. 
                My presentation linked <a href = "https://vimeo.com/608448162">here</a> and my extended abstract 
                linked <a href = "https://tfpiscom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/kwon.pdf">here</a> describe 
                the interface in more detail.
