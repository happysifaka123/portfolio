            <h3>Context and Problem</h3>
            <p> I completed this project as my assignment for the User Interface/User Experience class at Brown 
                in Fall 2022.<br><br>
                In Brown's Center for Information Technology (CIT), there's a coffee machine that is known for being difficult to use.
                To figure out what may be causing these usability problems, I explored ways in which users interacted with the coffee machine 
                through three user interviews. 
                Based on my findings, I created personas and storyboard reflecting the users' experiences of 
                making coffee with the machine.

            <p>Below are a sketch of the CIT coffee machine and descriptions about each of its numbered parts. 
                The machine uses "coffee pods" (sealed bags containing ground coffee) to brew coffee based on settings that the user chose.</p>

                            <li>The user can open the pod compartment (7) by pressing this button.</li>
                            <li>This display gives directions to the user during different steps of coffee making.</li>
                            <li>The user can press this button to get hot water instead of coffee.</li>
                            <li>Pressing this button brews espresso.</li>
                            <li>By pressing one of these three buttons, the user can set the strength of their coffee. Given the same amount of ground coffee, the “Mild” setting dilutes the coffee more with water than the “Bold” setting does.</li>   
                            <li>Pressing this button brews iced coffee. By default, the machine brews hot coffee.</li>
                            <li>This compartment opens when the user presses the “Open” button. Inside the compartment, there's a tray where the user can place a coffee pod.</li>
                            <li>This dispenses coffee.</li>
                            <li>This compartment contains used coffee pods. The user can open it to dispose the pods.</li>

            <!--Observations-->
            <h3 class = "persona-subtitle">Observations</h3>
            <p>I interviewed three users about the CIT coffee machine. 
                All three users were graduate students at Brown and drank coffee on a daily basis. 
                Although two out of the three users had never used the coffee machine before the interview, 
                all three of them had made coffee using their own tools.

                    <p class = "bolded">Questions</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have you used this coffee machine before this interview?</li>
                        <li>What tools have you used to make your coffee (e.g., french press, espresso machine)?</li>
                        <li>What are pros and cons of making coffee with this machine as opposed to using other methods you've used to make your coffee?</li>
                        <li>What are things you like and dislike about the UI design of this coffee machine?</li>
                        <li>What are satisfactory and unsatisfactory qualities of coffee made from this machine?</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class = "col-6">
                    <p class = "bolded">Summary</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All three users use non-automatic ways to make coffee such as french press and instant coffee powder when they are not in CIT. They liked that the machine in CIT <b>made coffee more quickly than the tools they used.</b></li>
                        <li>The two new users <b>could not initially figure out that the machine made coffee with pods</b> that were stored in shelves above the machine. They also said they had <b>trouble figuring out how to open the pod compartment.</b></li>
                        <li>The two new users pushed the pod compartment with their hand to close it <b>despite the warning message under the compartment telling them not to do so.</b></li>
                        <li>All three users pointed out that the <b>“Open” button for opening the pod compartment should stand out more</b> from other buttons and clearly indicate whether it opens the pod compartment or the compostable bin.</li>
                        <li>Two out of the three users said the coffee that the machine made was <b>too acidic or smelled unpleasant.</b></li>
                    </ul>

            <h3 class = "persona-subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>I completed this project as my assignment for the User Interface/User Experience class at Brown 
                in Fall 2022. Through this project, I learned to evaluate the usability of a product from its user's 
                perspective. It was especially meaningful to learn how to write user survey questions in unbiased ways.
