            <h3>Context and Problem</h3>
            <p>I completed this project as my assignment for the User Interface/User Experience class at Brown 
                in Fall 2022.<br><br>
                The goal of this application is to help the user place online orders from My Bakery. 
                To do so, the application allows the user to browse items sold at My Bakery, 
                filter and sort the items as desired, and add the items to the cart. 
                This application is valuable to the user, 
                because it allows the user to check out items sold at My Bakery 
                at anywhere in the world with internet access.</p>
            

            <h3>Usability Principles Considered</h3>
            <div class = "image-container">
                <img style = "width: 70em;" src = "../images/bakery_website.png">
            </div>
            <p>Please refer to the screenshot above for the descriptions below</p>
            <p class = "bolded">Sort and Filter</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The application allows the user to sort the listed items based on price 
                    (low to high) and review (high to low) to help users purchase cheaper items and/or highly rated items.</li>
                <li>To enable the user to view specific items that suit their preferences, 
                the application allows the user to filter items based on what the item's type is 
                and whether it is a seasonal item sold only during a limited period of time.</li>
                <li>All sections where the user can specify sorting and filter categories are highlighted with larger texts.</li> 
                <li>If the user wants to revert the listed items to their original state, they can click the "Reset All Filters" button to do so.</li>
                <li>To help users distinguish sections on the applications (e.g., sorting and filtering, cart, items listed), the website uses backgrounds with different colors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class = "bolded">Aggregate and Remove</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user can visualize items they added to the cart in the "Cart" section and keep track of the total cost of items they selected.</li> 
                <li>The user can remove items from the cart by simply clicking the "Remove" button next to each item.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h3>Organization of Components</h3>
            <p>I have two components, BakeryItem and CartItem.</p> 
            <p class = "bolded">BakeryItem</p>
            <div class = "image-container">
                <img src = "../images/BakeryItem.png">
            </div>
            <p>BakeryItem, which is shown above, is an item that is listed on the website, 
            and CartItem is an item that the user added to their cart. 
            A BakeryItem has an image an item, along with information about the item 
            and a button that allows the uer to add the item to their cart.</p> 
            
            <p class = "bolded">CartItem</p>
            <div class = "image-container"> 
                <img src = "../images/CartItem.png">
            </div>
            <p>A CartItem, which is shown as a part of the Cart section above, 
            has the name and the price of the item added and a button that allows the user to 
            remove the item from the cart.<br><br>

            Each of those two components descrobed above takes properties of certain items initially derived from 
            a json file and a function that needs to be executed when the user clicks a button in the component.</p>

            <h3>How Data is Passed Down Through Components</h3>
            <p>
                Once the app is initialized, data representing properties of each item in bakery-data.json are used to create their corresponding BakeryItem components. 
                A BakeryItem component takes these as props:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Properties (item image, name, type, review, price, and boolean value indicating whether the item is a seasonal item) derived from bakery-data.json and used to populate item information accordingly.</li>
                <li>An update function, which allows the user to add an item to the cart.</li>
            </ol> 
            <p>When the user adds an item to the cart, a CartItem component is created. A CartItem component takes these as props:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Properties (item name and price) derived from bakery-data.json and used to populate item information accordingly.</li>
                <li> An update function, which allows the user to remove an item from the cart.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How the User Triggers State Changes</h3>
            <p>A "state" in React can be used to modify certain components in a website. 
                The user can trigger state changes by clicking checkboxes to apply different filters or 
                selecting different sorting categories in a dropdown menu for sorting. 
                They can also reset the state of the two filters to their original states 
                by clicking the "Reset All Filters" button.</p>

            <h3>Finished website</h3>
            <p>You can check out my finished website <a href = "https://happysifaka123.github.io/cs1300-development/">HERE</a>!</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I learned how to build a website using state variables and components in React 
                and how to implement sort and filter functionalities. 
                I found these particularly useful when making websites with interactive components that follow consistent 
                structures such as this portfolio!
